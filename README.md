# Clueso Clone

## Overview
This project is a functional clone of **Clueso.io**, an AI-powered content engine that transforms screen recordings into professional product videos and step-by-step documentation.

The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate **product understanding, system design, and full-stack engineering fundamentals**, not to replicate Clueso’s internal AI complexity.

---

## Scope
Planned (to implement):
- User authentication
- Project creation
- Recording upload (mocked)
- AI processing pipeline (mocked)
- Dual output generation:
  - Video (placeholder)
  - Step-by-step documentation
- Text-based edits with re-generation (mocked)

---

## Intentional Simplifications
The following features are intentionally mocked or stubbed:
- Real screen recording
- Browser extension
- Video rendering and audio processing
- AI script generation
- Team management and billing

These are documented but not fully implemented to maintain focus on core workflows.

---

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Frontend: React
- Database: TBD (MongoDB / PostgreSQL)
- AI Layer: Mock service

---

## Backend Architecture
- Express + MongoDB
- JWT-based authentication
- Clear separation of routes, controllers, services

## Project Lifecycle
created → processing → ready

## Mock AI Processing
AI generation is simulated via a mock service that:
- waits asynchronously
- generates fake video URLs
- generates step-by-step documentation
